### v1.0.0 [[code][c1.0.0], [diff][d1.0.0]]

[c1.0.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v1.0.0
[d1.0.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v0.5.1...v1.0.0

This release includes major internal changes and public API enhancements.

- **Major** JSON5 officially supports Node.js v4 and later. Support for Node.js
  v0.10 and v0.12 have been dropped.

- New: Unicode property names and Unicode escapes in property names are
  supported. ([#1])

- New: `stringify` outputs trailing commas in objects and arrays when a `space`
  option is provided. ([#66])

- New: JSON5 allows line and paragraph separator characters (U+2028 and U+2029)
  in strings in order to be compatible with JSON. However, ES5 does not allow
  these characters in strings, so JSON5 gives a warning when they are parsed and
  escapes them when they are stringified. ([#70])

- New: `stringify` accepts an options object as its second argument. The
  supported options are `replacer`, `space`, and a new `quote` option that
  specifies the quote character used in strings. ([#71])

- New: The CLI supports STDIN and STDOUT and adds `--out-file`, `--space`, and
  `--validate` options. See `json5 --help` for more information. ([#72], [#84],
  and [#108])

- New: In addition to the white space characters space `\t`, `\v`, `\f`, `\n`,
  `\r`, and `\xA0`, the additional white space characters `\u2028`, `\u2029`,
  and all other characters in the Space Separator Unicode category are allowed.

- New: In addition to the character escapes `\'`, `\"`, `\\`, `\b`, `\f`, `\n`,
  `\r`, and `\t`, the additional character escapes `\v` and `\0`, hexadecimal
  escapes like `\x0F`, and unnecessary escapes like `\a` are allowed in string
  values and string property names.

- New: `stringify` outputs strings with single quotes by default but
  intelligently uses double quotes if there are more single quotes than double
  quotes inside the string. (i.e. `stringify('Stay here.')` outputs
  `'Stay here.'` while `stringify('Let\'s go.')` outputs `"Let's go."`)

- New: When a character is not allowed in a string, `stringify` outputs a
  character escape like `\t` when available, a hexadecimal escape like `\x0F`
  when the Unicode code p
